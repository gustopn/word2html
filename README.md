# word2html
I am using lately Office 365 Word to write some documents, so that I can edit them also on mobile devices as well as on a computer. Now Microsoft enables me to get these documents out as ODT Documents, which I can export into HTML using LibreOffice. Now I need a set of scripts which extract the body-tag contents out of all files and put it together into one HTML formated article.
